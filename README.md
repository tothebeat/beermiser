A fun app for people who want to get tipsy, like beer but aren't picky.

This is a web app to help my friends determine what beer on a bar's menu has the highest alcohol content per dollar cost. I personally don't drink beer and don't go out to bars, but I remember feeling motivated to do this in my early 20s.
